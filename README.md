* Below is just a bit of chicken scratch for practice
* I'm refreshing my version controll skills

1. HTML is important. 
```html
<p> This is test HTML </p>
```
2. JavaScript is important. 
```js
  console.log('Hello World');
```

* Note all changes to your local branch are recorded via the hidden .git file
  ---
  * `git add` <filename> enables git to start tracking changes to files 
  * `git add <file>` is saying, "git look at changes made on this file"
  * `git add .` track changes in all the files within this directory"

  * `git branch` shows what branch you're on 
  * `git push origin main` tells git where to merge to
